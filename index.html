                    <p>Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created and maintained by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton.</p>

                    <h4>Angular.js</h4>
                    <p>AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries.
                        Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs. Read on to find out how</p>

                    <h4>JQuery</h4>
                    <p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. 
                        It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much 
                        simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensbility, 
                        jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.</p>

                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>Usually, Complex automation systems are supplied of poor user interfaces. Often, software engineers don’t dedicate enough attention 
                        to the usability of system consoles and their panels, because automation system front ends are designed to be used by “skilled” operators.
                        With the large communication band today available, it’s possible to create distributed computing systems for real-time signals. 
                        Transferring real-time data over the net allows engineers and scientist to better understand fast phenomena and to control dynamic processes 
                        more precisely. In this branch of software, a key role is played by the usability and quick response of the user interface.</p>

                    <h4>The Goal</h4>
                    <p>We simulate a fast production system, capable to generate multiple data per second. the goal is to create a dynamic user interface 
                        capable to represent real-time phenomena, The open source project has to take advantage of the modern technologies and graphic 
                        tools available on the net.<br>
                        Reading and writing data through web services (restful or SOAP) is very easy, but in some cases not the best choice. 
                        When a critical system is monitored, you have to be sure that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>no signal component is left back, to ensure correct data analysis and to log data properly,</li>
                        <li>no message from the server is lost, to guarantee to remote users the right comprehension of what is going on.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>In such cases, the use of direct TCP connections between server and clients (through websockets for Javascript apps) has to 
                            be taken in right consideration.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <h4>The simulated system: SIMULATED CUTTING SYSTEM (SCS)</h4>
                    <p>
                        We will simulate a Cutting system, that is a plant composed by the following units:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Motor controls the speed production is done: higher speed means more products/unit of time.</li>
                        <li>Multiple-blade cutter, driven by the motor.</li>
                        <li>Injection circuit, to pump hot fluid.</li>
                        <li>Cooling system to control the plant temperature.</li>
                        <li>Hardware controller with some modules for I/O purposes.</li>
                    </ul>          
                    <p>
                        The plant produces different objects from a fluid hot plastic, the plastic is warmed by a specific unit. Fluid temperature 
                        and pressure are monitored. Fluid temperature and pressure cannot exceed their upper values otherwise pressure 
                        and temperature alarms are fired. The electrical motor drives a cutter, used to shape different products. The system 
                        can produce different products, generally indicated with name  product type 1, product type 2, etc. Fluid is injected 
                        into moulds of different types and the cutter shapes the products. For the purposes of the case study, it’ not very 
                        important that such production system exists. Real systems are probably more complex, but for this case study we 
                        need a simple model capable to generate fast data with a certain degree of coherence.
